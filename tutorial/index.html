    <p>The Reactive Stocks application has been created!</p>

    <h2>Explore the App</h2>

    <p>
        Once the application has been compiled and the server started, your application can be accessed at: <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
        Check in <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> to see the server status.<br/>
        <br/>
        The first thing you will see are three stock charts which are being pushed values in real-time from the server.  These values are simulated so the application always has interesting data flowing in real-time.  Clicking on a stock chart will fetch recent news mentioning the stock symbol, use a service to do sentiment analysis on each news, and then display a buy, sell, or hold recommendation based on the aggregate sentiments.  New stocks can be added to the list using the form in the header.

        The Reactive Stocks example combines Reactive Push, Reactive Requests, Reactive Composition, and a Reactive UI to create a Resilient, Interactive, Scalable, and Event-Driven application.  Check out the <strong>Hello Scala!</strong>, <strong>Hello Play Framework!</strong>, and <strong>Hello Akka!</strong> templates to learn more about those technologies.  Go back to the <a href="/home">Activator home page</a> to create a new application.
